# Building an X11 Window Manager

* [Part I: Setting things up](https://github.com/murtaza-u/window_manager_tutorial/tree/part_1)
* [Part II: Events](https://github.com/murtaza-u/window_manager_tutorial/tree/part_2)

**Note**: The final aim of this tutorial series was to build a fully
functional tiling window manager like this
[one](https://github.com/murtaza-u/devoidwm). I however no longer have
the time to complete it and I apologize for the same.
